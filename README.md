## 👤 About Me
* **Name:** Kavish Shah

* **Role:** Student & Aspiring Game Developer

## 🎮 Included Games
I have integrated three classic games directly into the site:
1.  **Ludo (2-Player):** A functional turn-based game for two players (Red vs. Blue) with a digital dice roller.
2.  **Snake:** The classic arcade game. Eat the red fruit to grow longer!
3.  **Minesweeper:** A logic-based puzzle. Click the tiles to find safe zones and avoid the hidden bombs.

## 🛠️ How to Set This Up Locally
1.  **Download the files:** Save the `index.html` file to your computer.
2.  **Add your photo:** Ensure your profile picture is named `image.png` and is kept in the same folder as the HTML file.
3.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click `index.html` to see your site!

## 🌐 Deploying to GitHub Pages
To make this site public:
1.  Create a new repository on GitHub named `my-website`.
2.  Upload `index.html` and `image.png`.
3.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Branch**, select `main` and click **Save**.
5.  Your site will be live in about 1-2 minutes!
